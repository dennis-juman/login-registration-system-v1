# login and registration system v1

This is a secure login and registration system. It uses PHPMailer in order to send verification emails to activate accounts. It's 100% secure and tested with 'sqlmap' and 'OWASP ZAP' on the highest levels. Even the verification link has been tested against SQL injections etc. It covers error codes nicely and randomizes the background on each visit as well.

All the code written except for PHPMailer have been purely coded by me. No copy pasting including the sytling (CSS).
This is just one of many method to build a login & registration system. 

In the future I will build a version that uses 3rd party authentication instead.
